## React Router Dom Nested Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using nested routes in React Router Dom.  The problem involves unexpected behavior when a nested route is defined within a parent route, leading to incorrect rendering or navigation problems. The nested route might not render as expected or might interfere with the parent route's rendering process.

The provided code demonstrates a scenario where a nested route (`/contact/form`) is defined within a parent route (`/contact`).  Under specific circumstances, the nested route may fail to render or may cause the parent route to render incorrectly.

The solution provided addresses this issue and ensures proper rendering and navigation functionality for nested routes.
